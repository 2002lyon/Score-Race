# Score-Race

**Rules**
a) You need to roll the dice, everytime you roll the dice you have the option to keep rolling the dice or holding your current score.
b) If the dice gets 1 when rolled, your current score which was being stored resets to 0. (However your previously held score won't be affected.)
c) The first person to reach the milestone of 100 points wins.
